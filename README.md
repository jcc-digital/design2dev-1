I modified the Figma design to be more developer friendly. 


### About Project
I am challenging my #development skills to not forget what I have learned over the years. As of recently, my roles have been in leadership where I did not get the opportunity to do much development work myself. If you don't use it, you lose it, right? Well, I certainly don't want to come across another assessment and go in shock like a deer in headlights. Hence, I am taking designs and developing them. The design in this exercise was created by Mr. Serge Eloka.

The video below shows my progress using #CSS #flexbox. I am first developing the desktop version, and then I will develop the responsive version.
Any feedback is welcomed, and I am looking forward to hearing from fellow frontend developers. I will also revisit this project when done to refactor the code.
